# Is Longer Really Better? 
## Analysis Of The Relationship Between Cooking Time And Average Enjoyment Rating
Authors: Alyxandrea Wikarsa & Jennifer Kuei

## Overview

This project is conducted at UCSD for the DSC80 course. In this project, we are taking a look at the relationship between cooking time and average enjoyment rating based on the given dataset.

Who doesn't prefer good food? With so many recipes available especially online, people rely on ratings to determine which dishes are worth the time and effort. However, a myriad of people prioritize convenience as well. Especially for college students where in a study conducted by Yugo News, 63% of students that don't cook state that time is the biggest barrier. This is why we are looking to find out if there is a relationship between the average time of cooking and the average rating of recipes as we want recipes that taste good and are fast.


The `recipe` dataset, taken from `RAW_recipes.csv`, contains 83782 rows, indicating 83782 unique recipes, with 10 columns recording the following information:
